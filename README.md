The application's interface displaying a correlation matrix for various numerical dataset features such as 'total_bill', 'tip', and 'size'. The matrix uses a color gradient from blue to red to signify correlation strengths, assisting in exploratory data analysis.

## Summary Statistics Feature
![Summary Statistics Feature](Screenshots/5.png)
Detailed summary statistics of a dataset are displayed, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for features like 'total_bill', 'tip', and 'size'. Additional statistical measures such as skewness and kurtosis are also provided.

## Statistical Analysis Options
![Statistical Analysis Options](Screenshots/6.png)
This part of the interface allows users to perform statistical analysis, showing options for selecting variables and statistical tests, such as the Chi-square test for independence. Results include a Chi2 statistic, P-value, and an expected frequency table.
## Histogram Visualization in Data Analysis
